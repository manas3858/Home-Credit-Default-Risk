# Home Credit Loan Default

![](https://www.threethriftyguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/default.jpg)

The objective of this project is to develop machine learning models to predict loan repayment abilities of each cutomer based on loan information and applicants available data.

The other major objective is to apply my learnings through a project, creating a central repository for the implementation of of all major classification algorithms namely: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost CLassifier, LightGBM Classifier, H20.ai AutoML classification.

To handle data imbalance, I tried SMOTE resampling and the inbuilt features of DT algorithms ('class = balanced' in RF and scale_pos_weight for boosting trees).
